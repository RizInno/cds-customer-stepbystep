# Creating an S/4 extension app in 60 minutes

When I was asked to host a CAP session as part of Devtoberfest 2023, I came back to a thought I was tossing around for a while: 

**Can I create a simple S/4 extension app in 60 minutes?** 

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="./img/screenshot1.png" alt="Screenshot 1" width="200"/></td><td align="center"><img src="./img/screenshot2.png" alt="Screenshot 2" width="200"/></td></tr></table>

... and as part of that bust a few myths: 
 1. "BTP based SAP development and deployment takes longer than building an in-stack ABAP app." 
 2. "SAP app development is not fast nor cost effective."

As developers in the SAP community we are  confronted with business requirements that needs a solution on a daily basis. Our job is to respond to these requirements as quickly as possible and contiously look for **maximum development velocity**. 

What I am showing you in the Devtoberfest Session (link to session) is how a few new SAP Technology Frameworks make a substantial difference. 

The frameworks I am referring to are: 
- SAP Cloud Application Model
- SAP Fiori element

## Business Benefits
Let me quantify this for you: 
- We built a custom on-premise, freestyle Fiori application using Fiori 1.0 & Hana 1.0 DB connected to SAP ECC 6.0. 
    - It took 20 days
- We recently rebuilt the same app on CAP and Fiori elements
    - It took 5 days

=> A reduction in development duration by 75%!

This might be an extreme example, but we @Rizing see patterns of substantial effort reduction when using CAP and Fiori Elements. Using these frameworks you get further benefits such as compliance with standard SAP floorplans and more granular scalability.
